# Stable Diffusion Api

This library is based on [jaschahuisman/sd-api] https://github.com/jaschahuisman/sd-api

I changed it for frontend working.

- I remove Sharp which only avaiable for backend and replace it to offscreenCanvas.

## Requisites

- To use this API client, you have to run `stable-diffusion-webui` with the `--api` command line argument.
- Optionally you can add `--nowebui` to disable the web interface.
